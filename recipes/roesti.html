        <h3><a id="description">Description</a></h3>
        <p>Roesti is a sort of pancake made from grated potatoes. The recipe hails from the German-speaking part of Switzerland.</p>
        <p>In fact, it's so typical that it gave rise to the phrase "Roesti frontier" to indicate the invisible line between the German-speaking part of the country and the French-speaking and Italian-speaking parts.</p>
        <p>Roesti is a pretty good basis for a main meal. Some side dish suggestions include mushrooms and cream, or ham, chestnuts, etc.</p>
        <h3><a id="ingredients">Ingredients (serves 4)</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg potatoes</li>
            <li>A bit of butter or oil for cooking</li>
            <li>You'll also need a large grate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a id="steps">Steps</h3>
        <p><em>Don't forget to wash your hands carefully before handling foodstuff!</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the potatoes until cooked throughout. This can be done with or without peeling them beforehand.</li>
            <li>Let them cool.</li>
            <li>Grate them over a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Warm up a pan on mid-heat.</li>
            <li>Add the butter or the oil in the pan.</li>
            <li>Shape the grated potatoes into balls. Their starch will keep them together.</li>
            <li>Place the balls in the pan and flatten them.</li>
            <li>Let them cook at least five minutes on each side.</li>
            <li>Serve as is or with the side dish of your choice.</li>

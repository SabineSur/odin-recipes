        <h3><a id="description">Description</a></h3></h3>
    <p>Crepes are a staple of French cuisine, and their origin dates back to Chandeleur: Candlemas. This celebration at the beginning of February hails the beginning of the end of the winter season. They're meant to evoke the Sun.</p>
    <p>Contrary to pancakes, crepes are thin; they can still be fluffy or crisp, depending on your taste.</p>
    <p>Q: Now, the Sun is all great and good, but can you spread it with jam and eat it? Can you?</p>
    <p><em>A: No, but you can do that with crepes.</em></p>
    <h3><a id="ingredients">Ingredients (about 10 crepes)</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 liter of milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of water</li>
        <li>250 grams of flour</li>
        <li>Butter or margarine (to heat up the pan)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a id="steps">Steps</a></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour ingredients in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Stir until you have a batter</li>
        <li>Let it rest for at least 30 minutes, at most 24 hours in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Stir lightly again</li>
        <li>Heat up a non-stick frying pan and grease it with butter</li>
        <li>When the butter sizzles, pour one ladle's worth of batter</li>
        <li>Wait for the batter to be cooked through; if you like your crepe fluffy, flip it as soon as the batter is cooked through. If you like it crisp, let it cook for a couple more minutes</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake</li>
        <li>Put the finished crepe on a plate</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 5-9.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note:</em> You might think it's excessive to grease the pan every time you cook a crepe. Trust me, it's not.</p>
    <p>That's it. Enjoy!</p>
